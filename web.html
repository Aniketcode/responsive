Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits.
Educational methods include teaching, training,
storytelling, discussion and directed research.
Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.
Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
feels, or acts may be considered educational

Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and 
through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners, this 
includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners.

Education designed to support early development in preparation for participation in school and society.
The programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. This is ISCED level 01.
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when
children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers and the educator.
These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest
levels of primary education.[18] Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim
at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.This is ISCED level 02.
